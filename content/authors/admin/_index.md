Hi, I'm Soumya Sharma! I'm a passionate researcher and engineer who thrives at the intersection of machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP). I'm currently working as a PreDoctoral Research in Google DeepMind in the AQUA (Agent Quality and Understanding Algorithms) team under \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/aravindan-raghuveer-9a724234}{Aravindan Raghuveer}. At Google, I have been working towards improving the writing style and tone in text in Large Language Models (LLMs). Before Google, I was working towards my M.S. (Research) in Computer Science & Engineering at IIT Kharagpur, where I was a part of the Complex Networks Research Lab, and was mentored by \href{https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pawang/}{Prof. Pawan Goyal} and \href{http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~niloy/}{Prof. Niloy Ganguly}. My work at IIT Kharagpur spanned everything from creating sophisticated datasets for financial document analysis to exploring cutting-edge NLP tasks like summarization and relation extraction and working on medical Natural Language Inference (NLI) task â€” some of which I've tackled alongside industry partners like Goldman Sachs, Samsung Research. You might have seen some of my research at conferences like \href{https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.219/}{ACL}, \href{https://aclanthology.org/D19-1631/}{EMNLP}, or \href{https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3487553.3524637}{WWW}. A complete list of my publications are provided in the Publications tab or on my \href{https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=LBNLcm8AAAAJ&hl}{Google Scholar}.

Before this, I was a Research Intern at Microsoft Research and even had a stint as a Software Engineer at Myntra, where I led projects that combined data science and engineering to capture trends in the fashion industry. I'm fluent in Python and C/C++, and I love working with frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow to bring ideas to life. Whether in academia or industry, I'm always up for solving complex problems and contributing to projects that push the boundaries of what AI and NLP can do.
